            <p class="subheader">Lead Archaeologist</p>
            <p>Born in the wind-carved mesas of southern Arkellen, Dr. Marrow grew up excavating ruins with her nomadic parents. Her work led to the discovery of the First Refraction Chamber—a crystalline vault containing what is believed to be the Aurivians’ solar calendar. Known for her precise excavation techniques using polarized lasers, she is respected (and feared) for her no-nonsense attitude and encyclopedic knowledge of color-coded sedimentation.</p>

            <p>Orien’s fascination with the Light Refractory Beings began when he decoded a pigment-inscribed manuscript at university. He now leads sociocultural reconstructions of Aurivian rituals using AI-assisted ethno-simulation. Charismatic and poetic, Thal theorizes that the Aurivians communicated complex social contracts through shared color immersion ceremonies.”</p>

            <p>A linguistic prodigy, Elira developed the first working syntax model of the Aurivian photoglyphic language—symbols that shift meaning based on ambient light. She’s working on an augmented reality headset that translates shifting glyphs in real-time. Elira is fluent in five human languages and two reconstructed color-dialects of Aurivian. She believes much of the Aurivian story is still misunderstood due to our linear perception of language.</p>
