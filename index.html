For millennia, the Light Refractory Beings — or Aurivians, as they called themselves — lived in harmony with the fabric of light itself. They believed every color carried a purpose: red for courage, blue for wisdom, and white for unity. Their mastery over light refraction allowed them to build radiant cities, create energy from color, and weave luminous threads into every facet of life.</p>
