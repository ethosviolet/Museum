Staff: I used AI to design all of the images and content 
for the backstory of the staff and their involvement in the fictional
project. The CSS was partially augmented by AI after I started to design it myself
I then took back what AI put out and edited it to my own specifications in keeping
with the style necessary to satisfy requirements.

Collections: I took the prompt from the assignment and fed it to AI to get all
of the content for the site. For the CSS and JS requirements in the project, AI read those
requirements in the prompt and added them into what it put out along with the content. I made sure
they fell in line with the styling by submitting my old CSS and AI spit out a new CSS style 
page that had my old CSS and new CSS that matched the style and requirements that were set forth for
this leg of the project. 

Shop: Here the AI client only generated images and content for the shop. I plugged it all in manually as 
instructed. Most of the content the AI put out for the prompts given was great on the first run. 
However there was one image that it spit out for the tote bag that I had to have 
it reasses because the image was not very much like the description at all. 

I must say that in my opinion it is somewhat disenheartening that the 
technology that I am up against possesses this kind of power and ability. It seems like it could
help a senior developer automate and speed through these types of simple tasks. I am feeling like I
need more speciailized knowledge in order to stand a chance of ever fitting into the workforce as
a software engineer.
